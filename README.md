# CenturyStack
Summary

Three variations of a Stack ADT created from an interface, accompanied by a modification activity.

Design

Implementations include Array-based Stack, ArrayList-based Stack, Linked List-based Stack. Supports classic Stack methods such as push, pop, peek. In the main method, the user is prompted to enter a message wherein the characters of that message are pushed to the Stack. A modification menu allows the user to change the message using the Stack object, with the following supported changes:

1) make all letters uppercase
2) make all letters lowercase
3) reverse the message
4) replace all occurrences of a character to another character
5) undo the most recent change
